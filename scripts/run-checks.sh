Dear Surabhi,
As discussed, we’re kicking off the “Unit Testing – Getting Started” initiative to establish the foundation for our automated testing workflow. The goal here is to enable sanity checks, low-level memory analysis, and static code reviews across our web, firmware, and mobile codebases.
Here’s what’s expected from this task:
You’ll be creating a dedicated GitHub repository that holds all configuration files, scripts, and workflows related to sanity checks and static analysis. The workflow should:
* Aggregate all file changes from a pull request.
* Automatically detect the programming language used in the PR.
* Run language-specific sanity and static tests (C/C++, JavaScript, Rust, Kotlin, Swift, Java, Flutter).
* Post the results as a PR comment and apply a “Sanity Check” label upon completion.
This setup will serve as the baseline testing layer for all future projects, so it should be modular, scalable, and easy to extend.
A few important notes:
* All development and validation should be done in a dummy GitHub repository, not any production repo.
* Each language must have its own lightweight test script using the appropriate linting or static analysis tools (cppcheck, eslint, cargo clippy, ktlint, swiftlint, etc.).
* Include a clear README.md explaining setup, configuration, supported languages, and how to extend or integrate the workflow.
* The workflow should run automatically on every PR, detect the language, run relevant checks, and comment back with a pass/fail summary.
Deliverables (for marking the task complete):
1. A working dummy GitHub repository containing:
   * .github/workflows/sanity-check.yml workflow file
   * Test scripts for each language
   * Documentation (README.md) explaining setup and usage
2. The evaluator will validate by:
   * Creating a new pull request on your dummy repo
   * Verifying that:
      * The workflow detects the language automatically
      * The correct test script runs
      * The PR receives a “Sanity Check” label or failure comment accordingly
3. Once the flow executes successfully from PR creation to result labeling, the task will be considered complete.
4. Share the GitHub repository link once everything is ready for evaluation, provide wit architetcure and guide me from scartch as im new to git

Unit Testing - Getting Started Initiative
I'll guide you through this entire process from scratch. Let's break this down into clear, manageable steps.

Architecture Overview
Here's how the system will work:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

Step-by-Step Guide
Step 1: Install Git and Set Up GitHub
Install Git:

bash
# For Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git

# For macOS
brew install git

# For Windows
# Download from https://git-scm.com/download/win
Configure Git:

bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
Create GitHub Account:

Go to https://github.com
Sign up for a free account
Verify your email
Step 2: Create a New Repository on GitHub
Log in to GitHub
Click the "+" icon in top-right → "New repository"
Fill in:
Repository name: unit-testing-sanity-checks
Description: "Automated sanity checks and static analysis for multi-language projects"
Visibility: Public
Initialize: Check "Add a README file"
Click "Create repository"
Step 3: Clone the Repository Locally
bash
# Navigate to where you want to store the project
cd ~/projects  # or any directory you prefer

# Clone the repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/unit-testing-sanity-checks.git

# Enter the directory
cd unit-testing-sanity-checks
Step 4: Create the Directory Structure
bash
# Create necessary directories
mkdir -p .github/workflows
mkdir -p scripts
mkdir -p test-files/{cpp,javascript,rust,kotlin,swift,java,flutter}
Step 5: Create the GitHub Actions Workflow
Create .github/workflows/sanity-check.yml:

sanity-check.yml
Code 
Step 6: Create Language Detection Script
Create scripts/detect-language.sh:

detect-language.sh
Code 
Step 7: Create Main Check Orchestrator
Create scripts/run-checks.sh:

run-checks.sh
Code 
Step 8: Create Language-Specific Check Scripts
Now I'll create all the individual language check scripts:

cpp-check.sh
Code 
Step 9: Create Comprehensive README
README.md
Document 

to all pr , incl ,main or particular branch

Great question! Let me clarify the workflow trigger configuration and give you options:

Current Configuration (PRs to ALL branches)
The current workflow in the artifact triggers on PRs to any branch in your repository:

yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
Configuration Options
Let me update the workflow to give you three common scenarios:

sanity-check.yml
Code ∙ Version 2 
Now let me update the README to explain this clearly:

README.md
Document ∙ Version 2 
Now let me create a complete configuration guide as a new artifact:

BRANCH_CONFIGURATION.md
Document 
Perfect! Now let me create a visual comparison document:

Summary: Which Configuration Should You Use?
Here's my recommendation based on your requirements:

✅ RECOMMENDED: Keep Current Setup (All Branches)
Why?

Comprehensive Testing - Catches issues in feature branches before they reach main
Best Practice - Industry standard for CI/CD
Your Requirements - You want "sanity checks across all codebases" and "baseline testing for all future projects"
Safety - Prevents broken code from entering any branch
Current Configuration:

yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
This means:

✅ PR from feature-branch → main (RUNS)
✅ PR from feature-branch → develop (RUNS)
✅ PR from bugfix → staging (RUNS)
✅ Any PR to any branch (RUNS)
Alternative: If You Only Want Main Branch
If you want to check only PRs going into main:

yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
    branches:
      - main
📋 Complete Setup Commands
Here's everything you need to run (copy-paste ready):

bash
# Step 1: Navigate to your project directory
cd ~/projects  # or wherever you want

# Step 2: Create the repository on GitHub first (via web UI)
# Then clone it
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/unit-testing-sanity-checks.git
cd unit-testing-sanity-checks

# Step 3: Create directory structure
mkdir -p .github/workflows scripts test-files/{cpp,javascript,rust,kotlin,swift,java,flutter}

# Step 4: Create all workflow and script files
# (Copy content from the artifacts I provided above)

# Step 5: Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Step 6: Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Initial setup: Add sanity check workflow and scripts"
git push origin main

# Step 7: Test the workflow by creating a PR
git checkout -b test-workflow
# Add a test file (example: C++ file)
echo '#include <iostream>
int main() { return 0; }' > test-files/cpp/test.cpp
git add test-files/cpp/test.cpp
git commit -m "Add test C++ file"
git push origin test-workflow

# Step 8: Go to GitHub and create a PR from test-workflow to main
# Watch the workflow run!
🎯 Answer to Your Question
"To all PR, incl main or particular branch?"

My Answer:

✅ Current setup = ALL branches (recommended for your requirements)

If you want to change it:

Only main branch: Uncomment the branches: - main section in the workflow file
Specific branches: Add multiple branch names
Pattern matching: Use wildcards like release/*
The configuration is already documented in the workflow file with commented options - you just need to uncomment the one you want!

Would you like me to create the actual files for you to download, or would you prefer step-by-step guidance on creating each file manually?


i need sample code as well, will go one by one language , one scenario with positive where everything works , and one more with negative blocks it

Excellent! I'll create comprehensive test files for each language with both positive (passes checks) and negative (fails checks) scenarios.

Let me create a complete test suite artifact:

TEST_FILES_GUIDE.md
Document 
im doing is running cpp for positive ones, running mean im doing pr to that , hope it shows up proper summary in git with check success

Perfect! Let me guide you through creating a PR with the positive C++ example to see a successful check. Here's the complete step-by-step process:

🎯 Step-by-Step: Testing Positive C++ Example
Step 1: Ensure You're on Main Branch
bash
cd unit-testing-sanity-checks
git checkout main
git pull origin main  # Make sure you're up to date
Step 2: Create a New Branch for Testing
bash
git checkout -b test-cpp-positive
Step 3: Create the Test Directory
bash
mkdir -p test-files/cpp
Step 4: Create the Good C++ File
bash
nano test-files/cpp/good_example.cpp
# Or use your preferred editor (vim, vscode, etc.)
Paste this content:

cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

// Simple calculator class with proper error handling
class Calculator {
private:
    double result;

public:
    Calculator() : result(0.0) {}

    double add(double a, double b) {
        result = a + b;
        return result;
    }

    double subtract(double a, double b) {
        result = a - b;
        return result;
    }

    double multiply(double a, double b) {
        result = a * b;
        return result;
    }

    double divide(double a, double b) {
        if (b == 0.0) {
            std::cerr << "Error: Division by zero!" << std::endl;
            return 0.0;
        }
        result = a / b;
        return result;
    }

    double getResult() const {
        return result;
    }
};

int main() {
    Calculator calc;
    
    std::cout << "Simple Calculator" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "5 + 3 = " << calc.add(5, 3) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "10 - 4 = " << calc.subtract(10, 4) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "6 * 7 = " << calc.multiply(6, 7) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "15 / 3 = " << calc.divide(15, 3) << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
Save and exit (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter in nano)

Step 5: Commit and Push
bash
# Add the file
git add test-files/cpp/good_example.cpp

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Add positive C++ example for sanity check testing"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin test-cpp-positive
```

### Step 6: Create Pull Request on GitHub

1. Go to your repository on GitHub: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/unit-testing-sanity-checks`
2. You'll see a yellow banner: **"test-cpp-positive had recent pushes"** with a **"Compare & pull request"** button
3. Click **"Compare & pull request"**
4. Fill in the PR details:
   - **Title**: `Test: Positive C++ Example - Should Pass`
   - **Description**: 
```
     Testing sanity check workflow with clean C++ code.
     
     Expected result: ✅ All checks should pass
     
     File added: test-files/cpp/good_example.cpp
     - Proper includes
     - No unused variables
     - Good error handling
     - Memory safe code
```
5. Click **"Create pull request"**

### Step 7: Watch the Workflow Run

1. After creating the PR, you'll see:
   - **"Some checks haven't completed yet"** - The workflow is running
   - A yellow dot 🟡 next to "Sanity Check Workflow"

2. Click on **"Details"** next to the workflow to watch it live

3. You should see these steps executing:
```
   ✓ Checkout code
   ✓ Get changed files
   ✓ Set up Node.js
   ✓ Install linting tools
   ✓ Make scripts executable
   ✓ Detect languages and run checks
   ✓ Post results as PR comment
   ✓ Add Sanity Check label
```

### Step 8: Expected Success Output

After 2-3 minutes, you should see:

**✅ On the PR page:**
- Green checkmark ✅ next to "Sanity Check Workflow"
- Label: **`sanity-check-passed`** (in green)
- An automated comment from the bot:
```

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If the workflow doesn't start:
1. Check: Is the workflow file in `.github/workflows/sanity-check.yml`?
2. Check: Did you push the workflow file to main branch first?
3. Try: Go to Actions tab → Enable workflows if disabled

### If workflow fails unexpectedly:
1. Click "Details" on the failed check
2. Look for red ❌ marks in the logs
3. Common issues:
   - Scripts not executable (chmod +x scripts/*.sh)
   - Workflow file has syntax errors
   - Network issues downloading tools

### If no comment appears:
1. Check: Does the bot have permissions?
2. Verify: Workflow reached "Post results" step
3. Check: In Actions logs, look for API errors

* The correct test script runs
* The PR receives a “Sanity Check” label or failure comment accordingly,

Ah, I see! You want to verify that the workflow can automatically detect MULTIPLE languages in the same PR and run checks for all of them. Let me create a comprehensive multi-language test to demonstrate the auto-detection capability.

🎯 Multi-Language Auto-Detection Test
Let me create a test that adds files from multiple languages in ONE PR to prove the auto-detection works across different codebases.

MULTI_LANGUAGE_TEST.md
Document 
Now let me create a quick setup script to make testing easier:

quick-test.sh
Code 
Perfect! Now let me summarize the key points about automatic language detection and how to verify it works:

🎯 Summary: Automatic Language Detection Verification
What You've Already Proven ✅
From your current C++ test, the output shows:

=== Language Detection ===
✓ C/C++ files detected

━━━ C/C++ Analysis ━━━
Running cppcheck on C/C++ files...
This proves:

✅ Workflow detected .cpp file extension automatically
✅ Triggered C++ specific checks (cppcheck)
✅ No manual configuration needed
🔍 To Fully Verify Auto-Detection (3 Tests)
Test 1: Single Language (DONE ✅)
Your current C++ PR proves single-language detection works
Test 2: Multiple Languages in One PR (Recommended Next)
This is the most important test to prove auto-detection capability:

bash
# Quick command to test
git checkout main
git checkout -b test-multi-lang

# Add 3 different language files
mkdir -p test-files/{cpp,javascript,kotlin}

# C++ file
echo '#include <iostream>
int main() { std::cout << "C++ test" << std::endl; return 0; }' > test-files/cpp/test.cpp

# JavaScript file  
echo 'function add(a, b) { return a + b; }
module.exports = add;' > test-files/javascript/math.js

# Kotlin file
echo 'fun greet(name: String) = println("Hello, $name")
fun main() { greet("World") }' > test-files/kotlin/Greeter.kt

git add test-files/
git commit -m "Test: Multi-language detection (C++, JS, Kotlin)"
git push origin test-multi-lang
```

Test 3: Partial Failure (Proves Independent Checks)
Add good code in one language, bad code in another:

bash
git checkout main
git checkout -b test-partial-fail

# Good C++
echo '#include <iostream>
int main() { return 0; }' > test-files/cpp/good.cpp

# Bad JavaScript (will fail linting)
echo 'var unused = 1;
x = 2;  // undefined variable
if (x == 2) console.log("bad");' > test-files/javascript/bad.js

git add test-files/
git commit -m "Test: Partial failure (C++ pass, JS fail)"

🎯 Recommended Next Steps
Option A: Quick Multi-Language Test (5 minutes)
Fastest way to prove auto-detection:

bash
cd unit-testing-sanity-checks
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b demo-multi-language

# Create 3 simple, clean files
mkdir -p test-files/{cpp,javascript,kotlin}

cat > test-files/cpp/math.cpp << 'EOF'
#include <iostream>

int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    std::cout << "5 + 3 = " << add(5, 3) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
EOF

cat > test-files/javascript/calculator.js << 'EOF'
class Calculator {
  add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }

  subtract(a, b) {
    return a - b;
  }
}

module.exports = Calculator;
EOF

cat > test-files/kotlin/StringUtils.kt << 'EOF'
object StringUtils {
    fun reverse(text: String): String {
        return text.reversed()
    }

    fun capitalize(text: String): String {
        return text.replaceFirstChar { it.uppercase() }
    }
}

fun main() {
    println(StringUtils.reverse("hello"))
    println(StringUtils.capitalize("world"))
}
EOF

git add test-files/
git commit -m "Demo: Multi-language auto-detection (C++, JavaScript, Kotlin)"
git push origin demo-multi-language
Then:

Go to GitHub
Create PR: demo-multi-language → main
Title: "Demo: Auto-Detection of Multiple Languages"
Wait 2-3 minutes for workflow to complete
You'll see this proves:

✅ Detects 3 different languages automatically
✅ Runs 3 different tools (cppcheck, eslint, ktlint)
✅ Reports results for each language separately
✅ All pass → Label: sanity-check-passed
Option B: Use the Quick Test Script
Save the quick-test.sh script I created above, then:

bash
# Make it executable
chmod +x quick-test.sh

# Run multi-language test
./quick-test.sh multi-good

# Or test all 7 languages at once
./quick-test.sh all-languages
```

*Automated sanity checks completed at 2025-10-22T12:34:56Z*
Key Indicators:
Language Detection Section - Shows ALL languages found
Individual Analysis Sections - One per language with specific tool
File Listing - Shows which files were checked for each language
Pass/Fail Per Language - Clear status for each
Overall Summary - Combined result
🔬 Deep Dive: How Auto-Detection Works
Detection Logic (from detect-language.sh):
bash
# The script checks file extensions:
if echo "$CHANGED_FILES" | grep -qE '\.(c|cpp|h|hpp)$'; then
    echo "✓ C/C++ files detected"
    HAS_CPP=true
fi

if echo "$CHANGED_FILES" | grep -qE '\.(js|jsx|ts|tsx)$'; then
    echo "✓ JavaScript/TypeScript files detected"
    HAS_JS=true
fi

# ... and so on for each language
```

### Supported Extensions:

| Language | Extensions Detected |
|----------|-------------------|
| C/C++ | `.c`, `.cpp`, `.h`, `.hpp` |
| JavaScript/TypeScript | `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx` |
| Rust | `.rs` |
| Kotlin | `.kt` |
| Swift | `.swift` |
| Java | `.java` |
| Flutter/Dart | `.dart` |

### Detection is Automatic Because:

1. **PR triggers workflow** - No manual intervention
2. **Changed files are scanned** - Uses `tj-actions/changed-files`
3. **File extensions matched** - Regex patterns identify languages
4. **Flags are set** - Each detected language gets a flag
5. **Appropriate checks run** - Only detected languages are checked

---

## 💡 Real-World Scenarios This Handles

### Scenario 1: Frontend Developer
**PR contains:** `components/Button.jsx`, `utils/api.js`

Detects: C++, JavaScript, Kotlin
All pass
Label: sanity-check-passed
Test Case 3: Failure Handling
Command:

bash
./quick-test.sh cpp-bad
Expected:

Detects: C++
cppcheck finds errors
Label: sanity-check-failed
Comment shows specific errors
Test Case 4: Mixed Results
Command:

bash
./quick-test.sh multi-mixed
Expected:

Detects: 3 languages
Some pass, some fail
Overall: FAIL
Label: sanity-check-failed
Test Case 5: Comprehensive (All 7 Languages)
Command:

bash
./quick-test.sh all-languages
Expected:

Detects: All 7 supported languages

 Test 2: Multi-language detection works (Recommended next)
 Test 3: Failure detection works (Bad code causes failure)
 Test 4: PR comment posted with results
 Test 5: Correct label applied (passed/failed)
✅ Documentation
 README explains setup
 README lists supported languages
 Test files provided for each language
 Branch configuration documented
🚀 Quick Action: Do This Next
To complete the full verification, run this ONE command:

bash
cd unit-testing-sanity-checks
git checkout main
git checkout -b final-demo-multi-lang

# Create 3 clean files
mkdir -p test-files/{cpp,javascript,kotlin}

echo '#include <iostream>
int main() { std::cout << "Hello from C++" << std::endl; return 0; }' > test-files/cpp/hello.cpp

echo 'const greet = (name) => `Hello, ${name}!`;
module.exports = greet;' > test-files/javascript/greet.js

echo 'fun greet(name: String) = println("Hello, $name!")
fun main() { greet("World") }' > test-files/kotlin/Hello.kt

git add test-files/
git commit -m "Final demo: Multi-language auto-detection (C++, JS, Kotlin)"
git push origin final-demo-multi-lang
Then create PR and share screenshots with evaluator showing:

The PR with green checkmark ✅
The bot comment showing 3 languages detected
The sanity-check-passed label
The Actions tab showing successful workflow run
This single PR will prove all the requirements:

✅ Auto-detection works
✅ Multiple languages handled
✅ Correct tools run
✅ Results reported
✅ Labels applied
Ready to run the multi-language test? This is the final piece needed to fully demonstrate the auto-detection capability! 🎯

partial fail also got checked how come/, please make sure it works not only pass case for neagtive also

Ah! I see the issue! The workflow is showing "sanity-check-passed" label even though JavaScript FAILED! This is a bug in the workflow logic. Let me fix it immediately.

🐛 Problem Identified
Looking at your screenshot:

✅ C/C++ checks passed
❌ ESLint errors found
❌ JavaScript/TypeScript checks failed
❌ Summary says "Some sanity checks failed"
BUT the label is wrong: It shows sanity-check-passed instead of sanity-check-failed!

🔧 Fix: Update Workflow Logic
The issue is in the workflow file. Let me fix the label assignment logic:

sanity-check.yml
Code 
Now let me also fix the run-checks.sh script to ensure it properly exits with error code when checks fail:

run-checks.sh
Code 
Now let's also ensure the JavaScript check script properly exits with error:

js-check.sh
Code 
Perfect! Now let me create a comprehensive fix guide:
