# 🧠 Unit Testing Automation – Sanity & Static Analysis Workflow

## 📘 Overview
This repository implements an automated **Sanity and Static Analysis Workflow** using **GitHub Actions**.  
The system validates Pull Requests (PRs) across multiple programming languages by performing quick static checks and syntax analysis before code merges — ensuring consistent, clean, and maintainable codebases.

The workflow detects the language of modified files, executes language-specific validation scripts, and posts formatted reports directly on PRs with pass/fail labels.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Automate sanity checks and static analysis for every Pull Request.
- Automatically detect the programming languages involved.
- Run lightweight, language-specific validation scripts.
- Post structured results as PR comments.
- Apply `sanity-check-passed` or `sanity-check-failed` labels.
- Provide a modular base for future CI/CD integration.

---

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Automatic Language Detection** – Detects languages from PR file extensions.
- **Selective Tool Installation** – Installs only necessary tools per PR.
- **Multi-Language Support** – Works for C/C++, JavaScript, Rust, Kotlin, Swift, Java, and Dart.
- **PR Integration** – Adds descriptive comments and result labels.
- **Merge Protection** – Prevents merging of failing PRs.
- **Extensible Design** – New languages and rules can be added easily.

## ⚙️ Workflow Configuration

**Workflow File:** `.github/workflows/sanity-check.yml`

```yaml
name: Sanity Check Workflow

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
  issues: write

jobs:
  sanity-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Run Sanity Check
        run: |
          bash scripts/detect-language.sh
          bash scripts/run-checks.sh
````

**How it works:**

1. Triggered automatically when a PR is opened, updated, or reopened.
2. Detects changed files and determines which languages are present.
3. Runs relevant scripts (`cpp-check.sh`, `js-check.sh`, etc.).
4. Aggregates results and posts them as a PR comment.
5. Adds the appropriate label (`sanity-check-passed` / `sanity-check-failed`).

## 🧠 Supported Languages and Checks

| Language                    | Tool / Method            | Key Checks                                                                                 |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **C / C++**                 | `cppcheck`               | Memory leaks, uninitialized variables, unsafe functions (`gets`, `strcpy`), include guards |
| **JavaScript / TypeScript** | Pattern / ESLint         | Console logs, use of `var`, `==`, `eval`, or `debugger`                                    |
| **Rust**                    | `cargo clippy` / Pattern | No `unwrap()`, safe error handling, no `println!` in libraries                             |
| **Kotlin**                  | Pattern / `ktlint`       | Wildcard imports, line length limits, multiple statements per line                         |
| **Swift**                   | Pattern / `swiftlint`    | No force unwraps (!!), no force casts (`as!`), style conventions                           |
| **Java**                    | Static Rules             | No `System.out.println`, proper class naming, no wildcard imports                          |
| **Flutter / Dart**          | Pattern Validation       | No print statements, proper class naming                                                   |

## 🧪 Example Test Setup

### For Repository Integration

1. Copy the `.github/workflows/sanity-check.yml` file to your repository.
2. Add the entire `scripts/` directory.
3. Ensure all scripts are executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/*.sh
   ```
4. Commit and push changes.

---

## 🧰 Expected Output

### ✅ Passing Example

```
✅ Sanity Check PASSED
Detected: C++, JavaScript
All checks passed successfully.
Label applied: sanity-check-passed
```

### ❌ Failing Example

```
❌ Sanity Check FAILED
Detected: JavaScript
Error: Found console.log() at line 12
Error: Used '==' instead of '===' at line 8
Label applied: sanity-check-failed
```

---

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding a New Language

1. Add file extensions to `detect-language.sh`.
2. Create a new script `scripts/<language>-check.sh`.
3. Add it to `run-checks.sh`.
4. Update this README and workflow file.

### Editing Check Rules

Each language script can be modified easily. Example:

```bash
# In js-check.sh
grep -n "console.log" "$file" && echo "Avoid console.log in production code"
```

---

## 🧩 Validation & Testing

The system has been validated using multiple Pull Requests containing good and bad code examples for each supported language.
Verification includes:

* Trigger accuracy on PR actions
* Language detection correctness
* Check execution and error reporting
* Comment posting and label application
